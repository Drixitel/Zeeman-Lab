# Data with Conclusive values found in: 
> `180Run3.ipynb`<br>
> `90Run3.ipynb`<br>
> `0_ZeroB.ipynb`
- Run1 for 90 and 180 are inconclusive 
- Run2 for 90 is useless and Run2 for 180 is inconclusive 

# Helper files: 
- `MarkdownError.md`: Has Error propagation formuals
  - `Error90.ipynb`: Computes Error Analysis for 90 Runs
  - `Error180.ipynb`: Computes Error Analysis for 180 Runs
- `LoopFilesInDir.ipnb`: Converts many files into arrays to process 
- `heperfile.py`: Contains all the functions used to process the data 

# Several `.txt` files: 
> These are all created/used across several notebooks so converting them to a pullable file was essential
