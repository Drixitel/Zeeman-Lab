 # Zeeman Spliting 
 - Assume previous values true and demonstrate the splitting 
 - Explain the relationship to spin and conservation of energy 
 # Final Report is very comprehensive 
 - See Data notebooks for full analysis 
 - helperfile was created to simplify the code however certain aspects were not automated such as trucation of data 
 # Results 
 - we found our fundamental constant to be in agreement with known Bohr Magnetron meaning the existance of spin was shown via our experiment.
